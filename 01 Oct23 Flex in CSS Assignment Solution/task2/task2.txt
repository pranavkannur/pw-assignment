1)justify-content: The justify-content property in Flexbox is used to control the alignment of flex items along
the main axis of the flex container. It determines how the extra space or insufficient space along the main
axis is distributed. There are several values for justify-content, including flex-start, flex-end, center, space-
between, space-evenly and space-around.

2)align-items: The align-items property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis of the flex
container. It specifies how items are positioned within their container along this axis. It accepts values such
as flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.

3)gap: The gap property is used to define the space between flex items in both directions, both along the main
axis and the cross axis. It's often applied to the flex container itself. It simplifies spacing and creates
consistent gaps between items without needing to apply margins to individual items.

4) flex-direction: The flex-direction property determines the direction in which flex items are placed within the
flex container. It defines the main axis and, consequently, the layout flow. It can have values such as row,
row-reverse, column, or column-reverse

5)flex-wrap: The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items are allowed to wrap onto multiple lines (new
rows or columns) within the flex container when they don't fit along the main axis. It accepts values like
nowrap, wrap, and wrap-reverse.
