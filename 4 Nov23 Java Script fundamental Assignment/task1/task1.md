## Q1: Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
Operators in JavaScript are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are essential in programming because they enable the manipulation of data, control of program flow, mathematical computations, and comparison of values. Without operators, programming would be static, lacking the capability to process dynamic information.
