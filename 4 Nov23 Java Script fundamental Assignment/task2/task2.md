## Q2: Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.
Operators in JavaScript can be categorized as follows:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform mathematical operations.
   - Examples:
     - `+` (Addition)
     - `-` (Subtraction)
     - `*` (Multiplication)
     - `/` (Division)

   - Examples:
     - `&&` (Logical AND)
     - `||` (Logical OR)
     - `!` (Logical NOT)

5. **Bitwise Operators**: Perform operations on binary representations.
   - Examples:
     - `&` (Bitwise AND)
     - `|` (Bitwise OR)

6. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**: Shorthand for if-else statements.
   - Example:
