## Q3: Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
- **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand.
  - Example:
    - `++` (Increment): `let a = 5; a++;` // a becomes 6

- **Binary Operators**: Operate on two operands.
  - Example:
    - `+` (Addition): `let sum = 5 + 3;` // sum is 8

- **Ternary Operator**: Takes three operands, typically used as shorthand for an if-else statement.
  - Example:
    - `let result = (score > 75) ? 'Pass' : 'Fail';`
