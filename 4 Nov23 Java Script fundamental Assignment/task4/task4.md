## Q4: Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?
**Operator Precedence** defines the order of evaluation of operators in expressions. Operators with higher precedence are executed before those with lower precedence. For example, multiplication ( * ) has a higher precedence than addition ( + ).

**Operator Associativity** determines the order of evaluation when two operators of the same precedence appear in an expression. Most operators are processed left to right, while some (like the exponentiation operator ** ) are processed right to left.

Understanding these concepts is crucial to ensure expressions are evaluated in the intended order, which helps prevent logic errors and unexpected results.
