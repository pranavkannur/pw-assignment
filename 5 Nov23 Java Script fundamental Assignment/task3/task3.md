# JavaScript Primitive Data Types

JavaScript has five primitive data types, each serving a unique purpose:

## String
Represents textual data. Enclosed in single, double, or backtick quotes.
```javascript
let name = "Alice"; // Example of a string
```
## Number ##
Represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers.
```javascript
let age = 25; // Example of a number string
```
## Boolean ##
Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
```javascript
let isStudent = true; // Example of a boolean
```
## Undefined ##
A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
```javascript
let car; // Example of an undefined variable
```
## null ##
Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's considered a primitive data type, although it refers to an empty or non-existent object reference.
```javascript
let selectedColor = null; // Example of a null value
```
