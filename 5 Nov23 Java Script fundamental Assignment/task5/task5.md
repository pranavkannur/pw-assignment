# Comments in JavaScript

## Importance of Comments

Comments in JavaScript are crucial for several reasons:

1. **Code Readability**: Comments make the code more understandable for others and even for the original coder when they revisit their work after some time.
2. **Documentation**: They can serve as inline documentation, explaining the purpose of specific functions or sections of code.
3. **Debugging**: By commenting out certain parts of the code, developers can test and debug individual sections without deleting them.
4. **Collaboration**: In team projects, comments help communicate the intent and functionality of the code to other team members.

## Examples of Comments

### Single-line Comment

A single-line comment is created by using `//`.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // Initialize variable x with a value of 5
```

## Multi-line Comment##
A multi-line comment is created by using `/* `to start the comment and `*/ `to end it.
```javascript
/* This is a multi-line comment
   It can span multiple lines
   Useful for detailed explanations or documentation */
let y = 10; /* Initialize variable y 
              with a value of 10 */
```
Comments are an essential practice in coding, ensuring the code is maintainable, understandable, and usable by others.
