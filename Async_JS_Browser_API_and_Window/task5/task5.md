2. **Fetch API:** The Fetch API provides a modern and powerful way to make network requests, replacing the older XMLHttpRequest. It's used to fetch data from a server, submit data to a server, and handle responses, making it an essential tool for working with APIs and web services.

3. **Geolocation API:** This API enables developers to retrieve the geographical location of the user's device. It can be used for location-based services, such as mapping, navigation, and providing personalized content based on the user's location.

4. **Web Storage API:** The Web Storage API includes localStorage and sessionStorage, offering a way to store data in the browser with more space and a simpler syntax compared to cookies. This API is useful for saving user preferences, settings, and other data that needs to persist across sessions.

5. **WebSocket API:** The WebSocket API allows for the creation of a persistent connection between the browser and the server, enabling real-time communication with low latency. It's ideal for applications that require live updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools.
